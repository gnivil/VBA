# VBA Challenge - The VBA of Wall Street
Analyze real stock market data.

# Stock Market Analysis
Created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
    * Ticket symbol
    * Yearly change from opening price to closing price of that year
    * Percent change from opening price to closing price of that year
    * Total stock volume of the stock
    * Conditional formatting highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red
# Bonus
The bonus solution returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". Adjustments made so the VBA script runs on every worksheet.
